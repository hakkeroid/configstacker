To get up and running you can check out the :doc:`quickstart tutorial
<quickstart>`. After that you should be able to easily integrate
configstacker into your project. If you want to dive deeper into
configstacker you can also read about more :doc:`advanced use cases
<advanced>` like :ref:`providing type information <advanced-converters>`,
:ref:`key-merge-strategies <advanced-merging>` or :ref:`adding
additional source handlers <advanced-extending>`. Finally the :doc:`api
documentation <api>` will cover all available features, classes,
parameters, etc.
